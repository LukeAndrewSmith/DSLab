- Ask clement what the tolerances for the FP are
    - c.f UETA20NE_shapeplot.jpg, feel like some should be marked as correct but

    - Still misses some
- __keepRightEdge_
    - Does too much
- __filterRegressionAngles
    - TODO
- __removeAfterCenter_
    - Should only remove if in the gap is after 1/2 along the image (as all? centers
        are futher than 1/2's along)
